### Currently Available Modifiers
### Transformations

# puts * wildcards around the values, such that the value is matched anywhere in the field.
contains:

# Normally, lists of values were linked with OR in the generated query. This modifier changes this to AND. This is useful if you want to express a command line invocation with different parameters where the order may vary and removes the need for some cumbersome workarounds.
all:

# The value is encoded with Base64.
base64:

# If a value might appear somewhere in a base64-encoded value the representation might change depending on the position in the overall value. There are three variants for shifts by zero to two bytes and except the first and last byte the encoded values have a static part in the middle that can be recognized.
base64offset:

#  The value is expected at the end of the field's content (replaces e.g. '*\cmd.exe')
endswith:

# The value is expected at the beginning of the field's content. (replaces e.g. 'adm*')
startswith:

# transforms value to UTF16-LE encoding, e.g. cmd > 63 00 6d 00 64 00 (only used in combination with base64 modifiers)
utf16le:

# transforms value to UTF16-BE encoding, e.g. cmd > 00 63 00 6d 00 64 (only used in combination with base64 modifiers)
utf16be:

# transforms value to UTF16-BE encoding, e.g. cmd > 00 63 00 6d 00 64 (only used in combination with base64 modifiers)
